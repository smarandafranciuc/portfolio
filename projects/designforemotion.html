        In march of 2020 my school started another team project that was very demanding and with a different goal in the
        end, compared to the rest of the regular school projects. Our team comprised of four people and we had a very
        clear task division, using Trello boards and making a cooperation agreement in the beginning of the project. We
        also had very important feedback moments which helped us grow as a team and understand, individually, how our
        contribution is valuable to the whole group.
        <br><br>
        The project started with us consensually picking an emotion that we would further explore and develop into a
        useful tool for real life problems. My team and I picked enchantment and from that moment on it was a full
        exploratory experience that gave us superb insights. Along the way, we realized that enchantment can be used to
        evoke love, to stir away attention from a bad thing, or even to help somebody relax after a heavy day.
        <br><br>
        Further, we decided to focus on using enchantment as a learning tool, taking action in developing a hypothetical
        situation in which pre-teen students are having a hard time concentrating in class. We thought of using either
        VR or AR in designing an interactive experience that stimulates the students into participating actively, while
        assuring retainability.
        <br><br>
        In the end, we decided to go for an experience that combined the best parts of all four of our concepts, and
        came up with the following final concept: a VR Museum of Curiosity where students can open a new door every week
        and, guided by their teacher, discover interactive adventures based on the subject of each lesson.
        <br>
        Our deliverable product would be a video prototype of the experience, and we settled on making an animation.
        <br><br>
        For the deliverable I primarily took care of drawing/designing the characters:
        <br><br>
        (Unfortunately, the animation video has been set to confidential for the moment by the owner.)
