        Project made in collaboration with Daria Brandenburg
        <a href="https://dariadbrandenburg.myportfolio.com">(https://dariadbrandenburg.myportfolio.com)</a>.
        <br><br>
        In January of 2019, during my gap year at the Royal Academy of Arts The Hague (KABK), we took on the task of
        designing and deciding the visual identity for the Open Day for the Interior Architecture department.
        <br><br>
        I played with a picture I took on a day when we were exploring the academy building and ended up in a corner we
        were not supposed to, by opening a locked door, and we liked what came out of it so we decided to turn it into
        the posters.
        <br><br>
        We decided on the color palette and then bumped into the problem of printing, and decided it was time to
        experiment with silk-screen printing, which we did.
        <br><br>
        The end product was the one in the pictures above, and the pictures below are the experiments that happened
        until we reached the final idea.
